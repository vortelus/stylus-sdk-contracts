//! Call other contracts.
//!
//! There are two primary ways to make calls to other contracts via the Stylus SDK.
//! - [`CallContext`] for richly-typed calls.
//! - The `unsafe` [`RawCall`] for `unsafe`, bytes-in bytes-out calls.
//!
//! Additional helpers exist for specific use-cases like [`transfer_eth`].

/// # Safety
///
/// If a contract calls another that then calls the first, it is said to be reentrant.
/// By default, all Stylus programs revert when this happened.
/// This method overrides this behavior, allowing reentrant calls to proceed.
///
/// This is extremely dangerous, and should be done only after careful review --
/// ideally by 3rd party auditors. Numerous exploits and hacks have in Web3 are
/// attributable to developers misusing or not fully understanding reentrant patterns.
///
/// If enabled, the Stylus SDK will flush the storage cache in between reentrant calls,
/// persisting values to state that might be used by inner calls. Note that preventing storage
/// invalidation is only part of the battle in the fight against exploits.
